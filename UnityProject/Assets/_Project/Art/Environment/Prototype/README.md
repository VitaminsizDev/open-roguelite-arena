# Prototype Environment Assets

Placeholder textures and shaders for greyboxing environments.

Current contents:
- `Textures/Grid_25cm.png` — 0.25m detail grid with world-space tiling.
- `Textures/Grid_50cm.png` — 0.5m grid for mid-scale blockouts.
- `Textures/Grid_1m.png` — 1m grid with bold guides every four tiles.
- `Textures/Grid_2m.png` — 2m grid for large arena sections.
- `Textures/Grid_4m.png` — 4m macro grid for massive structures.
- `Shaders/WorldTiledGround.shader` — world-space tiled URP shader so grid density stays consistent regardless of mesh scale.

Feel free to extend this folder with additional prototype materials or meshes. Replace with final art when the environment is locked.
